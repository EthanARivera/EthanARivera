I'm currently just learning the basics of programming, researching plenty of information about the topic and currently learning to use Java (just as an introduction).
I plan on mastering (or learn) as much as i can the Java programming language, which will grant me the basics, and then look for some new and maybe more useful language.
I'm open to any kind of suggetions, recommendations, and advices.
